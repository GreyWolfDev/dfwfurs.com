                    The meet organizers for the DFW Furs Community are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meet attendees in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the respective meet where the harassment occurs at the discretion of the meet organizers.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #9b9b9b !important; font-size: medium !important">
                    If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome at any of our meets, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our meets for everyone. We want you to be happy at our meets. People like you make our event a better place.

                    When taking a personal report, the meet organizers will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other meet organizers or admins to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #9b9b9b !important; font-size: medium !important">
                    We value your attendance and look forward to creating a better, safer community for all!
